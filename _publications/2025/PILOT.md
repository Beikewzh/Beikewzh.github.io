  Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize unseen defects without requiring any labeled anomalies, but existing methods struggle to generalize under domain shifts. We propose PILOT, a framework combining a dual-branch prompt learning mechanism with label-free test-time adaptation, enabling dynamic adaptation to new distributions using only unlabeled data. PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks for both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.
