  We propose Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), a method that incorporates a graph encoder-decoder into goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (GCHRL) to address sample inefficiency and subgoal representation issues. G4RL leverages state graphs built during exploration to provide intrinsic rewards and enable effective evaluation of unseen states, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that G4RL consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL methods in both dense and sparse reward settings with minimal computational overhead.
