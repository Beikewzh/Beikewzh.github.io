  We present GitChameleon 2.0, a dataset of 328 Python code completion problems conditioned on specific library versions, each paired with executable unit tests for rigorous, execution-based evaluation. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs and code assistants struggle with version-conditioned code generation, achieving only 48â€“51% success rates. GitChameleon 2.0 provides a challenging benchmark to spur advances in adaptable and robust AI code generation.
