  We implement DeepIV, a pioneering framework that combines deep learning and instrumental variables for causal inference, to predict the effect of educational background on annual income using real-world datasets. Our results show that DeepIV achieves causal effect predictions comparable to established causal inference models and performs on par with traditional supervised learning methods. This demonstrates DeepIVâ€™s practical reliability for real-world causal inference tasks.
