  We show that pre-training deep learning models on pre-pandemic health records and fine-tuning them with limited pandemic data can substantially improve ECG-based COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. This transfer learning approach demonstrates notable gains across three prediction tasks, highlighting its potential for rapid AI deployment in future outbreaks.
