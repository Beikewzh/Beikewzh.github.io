  We propose SPGNet, a method for 3D human pose estimation that integrates multi-dimensional re-projection into supervised learning. Our approach enforces kinematic constraints and jointly optimizes both 2D and 3D pose consistency, leading to improved accuracy. Experiments on the Human3.6M dataset show that SPGNet outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.
