    Whenever I get tired of coding or reading papers, I like to relax by going out and taking pictures. Photography helps me slow down and notice the little things around me. Sometimes it's a cool city view, sometimes it's just the way the light hits a wall, or a quiet moment in nature. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ‡

    I'll keep updating this page with some of my favorite shots. Hope these photos help you take a break and chill, especially if youâ€™re having a busy day. Enjoy! âœ¨ðŸ“¸
