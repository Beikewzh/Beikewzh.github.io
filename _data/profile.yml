    I am a first-year Ph.D. student at McGill University and Mila – Quebec AI Institute, co-advised by Prof. Doina Precup and Prof. Xiao-Wen Chang. My research focuses on continual reinforcement learning, aiming to develop AI systems that can learn and adapt in non-stationary environments. I am also a Board Member of ContinualAI, a nonprofit organization advancing research in continual learning.

    Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill and Mila, under the supervision of Prof. Narges Armanfard and Prof. Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, where I worked on anomaly detection. I also hold a B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a Minor in Mathematics, from the University of Alberta.
